/**
 * @author https://github.com/secretdataz/BetterFonts
* The StringCache is the public interface for rendering of all Unicode strings using OpenType fonts. It caches the glyph layout
* of individual strings, and it uses a GlyphCache instance to cache the pre-rendered images for individual glyphs. Once a string
* and its glyph images are cached, the critical path in renderString() will draw the glyphs as fast as if using a bitmap font.
* Strings are cached using weak references through a two layer string cache. Strings that are no longer in use by Minecraft will
* be evicted from the cache, while the pre-rendered images of individual glyphs remains cached forever. The following diagram
* illustrates how this works:
*
* <pre>
* String passed to Key object considers Entry object holds Each Glyph object GlyphCache.Entry stores
* renderString(); all ASCII digits equal an array of Glyph belongs to only one the texture ID, image
* mapped by weak to zero ('0'); objects which may Entry object; it has width/height and
* weakRefCache mapped by weak not directly the glyph x/y pos normalized texture
* to Key object stringCahe to Entry correspond to Unicode within the string coordinates.
* chars in string
* String("Fi1") ------------\ ---> Glyph("F") ----------> GlyphCache.Entry("F")
* N:1 \ 1:1 1:N / N:1
* String("Fi4") ------------> Key("Fi0") -------------> Entry("Fi0") -----+----> Glyph("i") ----------> GlyphCache.Entry("i")
* \ N:1
* ---> Glyph("0") -----\
* ----> GlyphCache.Entry("0")
* ---> Glyph("0") -----/
* N:1 1:1 1:N / N:1
* String("Be1") ------------> Key("Be0") -------------> Entry("Be0") -----+----> Glyph("e") ----------> GlyphCache.Entry("e")
* \ N:1
* ---> Glyph("B") ----------> GlyphCache.Entry("B")
