### üîπ Installation
This mod is an ***update*** to CustomNPC and not an add-on. Do not install CustomNPC with CustomNPC-Plus. CustomNPC-Plus does not remove any functional features from the original mod. It expands upon CustomNPC with original features and backported features from newer versions. Simply drag CustomNPC-Plus into any client/server mods folder to utilize.
